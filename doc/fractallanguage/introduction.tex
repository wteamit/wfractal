\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Scope}

Scope of this document is to describe the language used for specifying a fractal.

In order to allows users to develop their own fractal formulas, it's possible to describe them in a text. It's possible to create a script that represents the fractal, with many options that we'll go to analyse.

Then, the script must be parsed from the program in order to create a AST\footnote{Abstract Syntax Tree} that can be used by the program.
