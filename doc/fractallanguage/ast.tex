\section{Introduction}

In this chapter we'll analyse the structure of the Abstract Syntax Tree used by the program in order to represent the fractal. The AST will be run then in order to execute the program that it represents.

\section{Trees and Maps}

A Tree is a data structure that contains nodes and leafs. A special node called \emphasis{root} is the top-level node of the tree, its starting point. The root is linked to many nodes, and the nodes to other nodes themselves, until a leaf is reached. A leaf is simply a node with no children.
